            <h2>About Machine Learning</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn 
              from data and improve their performance over time without being 
              explicitly programmed.Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
               paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a 
               paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas 
               among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single 
               sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section 
               in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph 
               can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. 
               In this handout, 
              we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>

                    <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a brain condition that causes problems with movement, mental health, sleep, pain, and other health issues. It is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand.</p>
