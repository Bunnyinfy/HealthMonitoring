### Comprehensive Health Monitoring System

#### Overview
The **Comprehensive Health Monitoring System** is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of three critical diseases: **Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease**. The system leverages predictive modeling techniques to aid in early diagnosis and efficient health monitoring.

#### Features
- **Disease Prediction**: Supports predictions for Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built using **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for accurate results.
- **Performance**: Achieved an accuracy of **87.6%** with a **70-30 train-test data split**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified prediction mechanism for ease of use by healthcare professionals and patients.

#### Models and Approach
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Utilized for binary classification tasks.
   - Effective in predicting outcomes based on input features.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - Employed for classification with a high margin of separation between classes.
   - Works well with both linear and non-linear datasets.

#### Data
- **Datasets**: Collected from reliable medical databases containing features related to Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease.
- **Preprocessing**: Data normalization and cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Selection**: Key attributes selected for efficient model training and better predictions.
